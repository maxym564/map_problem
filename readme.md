# Movie and Map
On the web map, draw information about the places where films were shot that were shot in a particular year. Location information is available in the locations.list files.
The user indicates for the films for which year he wants to build a map and his location as latitude (longitude) and longitude (longitude) (for example, 49.83826, 24.02324), and as a result receives an HTML file.
